## Overview

This project aims to investigate and analyze GitHub user IDs, focusing on understanding the significance of these IDs and exploring some interesting facts about them. GitHub assigns a unique numerical ID to each user, and these IDs can reveal insights about the early adopters of the platform.

These IDs are incremented sequentially, meaning that users with lower IDs joined the platform earlier.

_Developed out of a small curiosity from GitHub user #156575830_
